<p>I hate those annoying bot created splash pages that tell you there is no web page yet. This isn't much better. But at least it is evident that a human coded this much. I have to retrieve my page coding skills from three years ago when I built worldofwebb.net/rva_resources. Once I do that I'll be able to make this a mobile first design with style sheets and all the other happy shit.</p>
