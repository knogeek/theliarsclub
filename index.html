<p>I hate those annoying bot created splash pages that tell you there is no web page yet. This isn't much better. But at least it is evident that a human coded this much. I have to retrieve my page coding skills from three years ago when I built worldofwebb.net/rva_resources. Once I do that I'll be able to make this a mobile first design with style sheets and all the other happy shit.</p>
  <p>Now, what is the Liars Club? It is a social gathering of writers and storytellers who risk telling stories that are hard to tell and in the telling discover a community. We encourage tall tales, the taller the better. It's founder, Alan Webb, has found that the stuff he has been afraid to write has been the stuff that gets the most page views. Mr. Webb is looking for fellow odd folk who delight in telling lies and damned lies for fun.</p>
