<h1>The Liars Club</h1>
<img src="flamingpants.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:100%;height:auto">
<p>The Liars Club is a social gathering of writers and storytellers who risk telling stories that are hard to tell and in the telling discover a community. We encourage tall tales, the taller the better. It's founder, Alan Webb, has found that the stuff he has been afraid to write has been the stuff that gets the most page views. Mr. Webb is looking for fellow odd folk who delight in telling lies and damned lies for fun.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://meetu.ps/e/Fp7Pf/wsyCt/f">Flaming Pants Night</a></span> is our only event so far. It is a chance to tell stories you worry about telling for fear of rejection. Such as? From Mr. Webb's college creative writing class: a bra theif who steals from the laundramat. A girl finds a Cadillac Escalade with suitcases of clothes, cash and body parts. A gaming computer that is disconnected from power and networking and yet comes on to display tweets which demonstrate an unnerving knowledge of what she does in the witching hours.</p 
<p>I can only make time for 12 storytellers each Thursday. Audience? More, much much more. If we could fill a stadium that would be awesome. The venue seats 100 people or so. If it gets bigger we will move it to somewhere that can accomodate the crowd. Right now there are only two of us that attend regularly. So there is plenty of room for more storytellers and people who want to hear a good story.</p>
  <h2>Flaming Pants Night</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://meetu.ps/e/Fp7Pf/wsyCt/f">Flaming Pants Night</a></span> happens every Thursday from 7:00pm to 9:00pm at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BC5vDJYpdYJ2">Urban Farmhouse, 3015 Norfolk Street, Richmond, VA 23230.</a></p>
  <p>Last, my hobby for the last few years has been this blog: <span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://www.worldofwebb.net">World of Webb</a></span>. The blog is a mix of fiction and commentary on religion, philosophy, and current events. I chose to make fact serve the story. It means the blog's primary writer is an unreliable narrator. Between entertaining and enlightening the blog leans more toward entertaining. Please click over to it and mayhaps subscribe through WordPress.</p>
