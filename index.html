<h2>The Liars Club</h2>

<p style="font-family:Cambria">Progress. This is still hand-coded. I cribbed from the code I wrote for <a href="http://worldofwebb.net/rva_resources"><span style="font-weight:bold">RVA Resources</span></a>. It won't be hand-coded forever. To promote events from The Liars Club we are going to need an awesome design. For now this is as good as it gets.</p>
<p style="font-family:Cambria">Now, what is the Liars Club? It is a social gathering of writers and storytellers who risk telling stories that are hard to tell and in the telling discover a community. We encourage tall tales, the taller the better. It's founder, Alan Webb, has found that the stuff he has been afraid to write has been the stuff that gets the most page views. Mr. Webb is looking for fellow odd folk who delight in telling lies and damned lies for fun.</p>
  <p style="font-family:Cambria"><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://meetu.ps/e/Fp7Pf/wsyCt/f">Flaming Pants Night</a></span> is our only event so far. It is a chance to tell stories you worry about telling for fear of rejection. Such as? From Mr. Webb's college creative writing class: a bra theif who steals from the laundramat. A girl finds a Cadillac Escalade with suitcases of clothes, cash and body parts. A gaming computer that is disconnected from power and networking and yet comes on to display tweets which demonstrate an unnerving knowledge of what she does in the witching hours.</p 
  <p style="font-family:Cambria">I can only make time for 12 storytellers each Thursday. Audience? More, much much more. If we could fill a stadium that would be awesome. The venue seats 100 people or so. If it gets bigger we will move it to somewhere that can accomodate the crowd. Right now there are only two of us that attend regularly. So there is plenty of room for more storytellers and people who want to hear a good story.</p>
<p style="font-family:Cambria"><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://meetu.ps/e/Fp7Pf/wsyCt/f">Flaming Pants Night</a></span> happens every Thursday from 7:00pm to 9:00pm at the Urban Farmhouse, 3015 Norfolk Street, Richmond, VA 23230.</p>
